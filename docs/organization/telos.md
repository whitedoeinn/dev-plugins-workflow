## Purpose (Why We Exist)

To make AI-augmented development accessible, consistent, and compounding - so individuals and small teams can build with the quality and velocity of much larger organizations.

## Mission (What We Do)

We create development workflows, standards, and tooling that embed best practices into daily work, reducing cognitive load and ensuring quality without slowing down.

## Values (How We Operate)

| Value | Meaning | Anti-Pattern |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Compound over clever** | Each piece of work should make future work easier | One-off solutions that don't generalize |
| **Automate the obvious** | If a human shouldn't need to remember it, a machine should handle it | Manual checklists that get skipped |
| **Accessible by default** | Non-developers should be able to use AI tools safely | Expert-only interfaces, jargon-heavy docs |
| **Standards as guardrails** | Conventions prevent mistakes, not creativity | Rigid rules that block good judgment |
| **Learn in public** | Document decisions, capture learnings, share patterns | Tribal knowledge that dies with individuals |

## Vision (Where We're Going)

A world where solo founders and small teams can ship production-quality software with AI assistance, guided by workflows that encode decades of engineering wisdom. Development standards that are living documents, evolving from real work rather than theoretical ideals.

## Priority Framework (How We Decide)

When facing tradeoffs, we prioritize:

1. **Safety over speed** - Guardrails that prevent mistakes beat velocity that creates technical debt
2. **Simplicity over flexibility** - Opinionated defaults beat configurable complexity
3. **Compounding over completeness** - Ship something that teaches us, iterate based on learnings

## Contribution Focus (Our Unique Value)

We bridge the gap between "AI can write code" and "AI can ship quality software." Our workflows operationalize software engineering wisdom - the kind that usually takes years to develop - into repeatable, AI-friendly patterns.

## What We Don't Do

- **Enterprise sales** - We build for individuals and small teams, not procurement processes
- **Framework wars** - We're language/framework agnostic; our patterns work everywhere
- **Premature abstraction** - We build what we need today, not what we might need someday
- **Closed ecosystems** - Our tools integrate with existing workflows, not replace them

## Learnings Log

Track identity-relevant learnings from features and projects.

| Date | Learning | Source | Action |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2026-01-12 | "Accessible by default" value emerged from config-sync feature - non-developers need guardrails | env-baseline feature | Added value to TELOS |
| 2026-01-12 | Learnings have no permanent home in current workflow | feature workflow review | Research study initiated |
