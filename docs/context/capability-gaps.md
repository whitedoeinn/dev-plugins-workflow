# Capability Gaps Assessment

**Source Project:** `/Users/davidroberts/vscode-projects/google-ads`
**Status:** For evaluation after ralph migration
**Created:** 2026-01-12

## Purpose

Document any useful enhancements from the google-ads repo that are missing from dev-plugins-workflow. These are capabilities that exist in the source project's versions of commands/skills that may not be present in the plugin's versions.

## Areas to Compare

### Feature Command Differences
- [ ] Compare google-ads feature workflow with plugin's `/feature` command
- [ ] Note any unique capabilities in source
- [ ] Evaluate if worth porting

### Commit Skill Differences
- [ ] Compare source commit workflow with plugin's commit skill (say "commit these changes")
- [ ] Note any unique capabilities
- [ ] The plugin version is considered authoritative

### Auto-Update-Docs Differences
- [ ] Compare documentation sync approaches
- [ ] Note any unique capabilities

### Standards/Scaffolding Differences
- [ ] Compare any project setup capabilities
- [ ] Note any unique capabilities

## Recommendations
